# Question 1
How do you expect the rigid **pendulum** will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency (\(w_{0}=\sqrt{g/L}\)) of the **pendulum** (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the **pendulum**?

> When the driving frequency is much lower than the natural frequency (), the **pendulum** follows the driving force with nearly the same phase and frequency, with amplitude proportional to the driving amplitude. When the driving frequency is much higher than the natural frequency (), the **pendulum** barely responds to the driving force, showing very small amplitude oscillations that decrease proportionally to  as frequency increases, and with approximately 180Â° phase difference from the driving for

# Question 2
If the **pendulum** is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?

> The **pendulum's** displacement angle will increase when the pivot point moves down abruptly due to the inertial effects on the **pendulum** bob.


# Question 3
If we start the **pendulum** oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior? 

> The **pendulum** will experience reduced angular acceleration compared to a fixed pivot, and if the pivot descends rapidly (approaching free-fall), the **pendulum** may remain near its unstable position for an extended period.
