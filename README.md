# rigid-pendulum

# Question 1
How do you expect the rigid **pendulum** will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency () of the **pendulum** (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the **pendulum**?

>

# Question 2
If the **pendulum** is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?

>

# Question 3
If we start the **pendulum** oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior?
